reflect-and-negotiate/ focusses on my past experience of on-call connected with a more general call to the audience to reflect on their own professional lives and encouragement to negotiate what is healthy for them. This is for a more general audience than (dev)ops specialists or managers building environments.

Another subfolder for such specialised audiences is coming in the future with reflections on what to do differently to build a healthier on-call culture.
